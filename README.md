# Higher Education Outcomes Analysis  üìäüéì

## Overview
This project dives into an in-depth analysis of U.S. colleges and universities to uncover the institutional characteristics that shape graduates' median earnings 10 years after enrollment. By blending exploratory data analysis (EDA), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Random Forest modeling, this study offers actionable insights into the factors that drive the return on investment in higher education.

## Objective
To pinpoint and quantify the top factors influencing graduate earnings, providing data-driven insights that benefit students, educators, and policymakers in decision-making.

## Project Highlights
- **üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to reveal data patterns and relationships.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Modeling Approaches**:
  - **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**: Serves as an interpretable model and baseline.
  - **Random Forest**: Captures complex, non-linear interactions for comparison.
- **üìà Model Evaluation**:
  - Key metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were calculated and analyzed.

## Data Source
The analysis uses the **2014-15 cohort dataset** from the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard. Due to the dataset's large size, it is not included in this repository but can be accessed [here](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/).

## Key Findings
- Factors like median family income, faculty salary, and Pell Grant percentage showed significant relationships with graduate earnings.
- The MLR model showed an R-squared value of ~0.69 on the test set, while the Random Forest model yielded even stronger performance.
