# Higher Education Outcomes Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the factors influencing student outcomes at U.S. colleges and universities, focusing on how various institutional characteristics affect graduates' median earnings 10 years after enrollment. The analysis includes detailed data exploration, modeling using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest, and key insights drawn from model evaluations.

## Objective
To identify and quantify the most significant factors impacting graduate earnings and provide valuable insights into the return on investment in higher education.

## Project Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**: Used for interpretability and baseline performance.
  - **Random Forest**: Applied for comparison and to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Model Evaluation**: Key metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were calculated and analyzed.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the **2013-14 cohort dataset** from the [U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). Due to the large size of the dataset, it is not included in this repository.

## Key Findings
- Factors like median family income, faculty salary, and Pell Grant percentage showed significant relationships with graduate earnings.
- The models demonstrated strong predictive power, with R-squared values of approximately 0.69 on the test set for MLR and higher performance from the Random Forest model.
