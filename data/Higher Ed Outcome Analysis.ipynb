    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides insights into factors that significantly influence median earnings for college graduates 10 years after enrollment. The findings underscore the importance of several institutional characteristics and socioeconomic factors, leading to actionable recommendations for both colleges and prospective students.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Support Low-Income Students**: Institutions with a higher proportion of Pell Grant recipients tend to see lower post-graduation earnings among graduates. To bridge this earnings gap, colleges should implement robust support systems tailored to low-income students, including career counseling, financial literacy programs, and mentorship opportunities. For students, especially those from low-income backgrounds, selecting institutions with established support structures can positively impact long-term earnings outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invest in Faculty**: The analysis reveals a positive correlation between faculty salary and graduate earnings. Higher faculty salaries may signal a commitment to faculty quality, which can lead to better educational outcomes and increased earnings potential for students. Institutions should prioritize faculty investment to enhance educational quality, while students should consider faculty quality as an important factor when evaluating colleges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhance Retention Programs**: Higher completion rates are associated with stronger financial outcomes post-graduation. Colleges should focus on retention strategies, such as advising, mental health resources, and academic support, to help students persist through graduation. For students, seeking out colleges with high retention rates and strong graduation support services may lead to better financial outcomes after graduation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reduce Financial Barriers**: While debt levels have a modest impact on earnings, minimizing student debt can alleviate financial stress for graduates. Colleges are encouraged to expand need-based financial aid options to reduce student reliance on loans. Students can also take steps to limit debt by exploring grants, work-study programs, and other funding sources that reduce the need for borrowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Future Research and Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could explore the long-term effects of support programs and financial aid policies on graduate earnings to deepen understanding of how institutional characteristics impact student success. Policymakers may also consider these findings when shaping education funding policies to support equitable outcomes for all students.\n"
